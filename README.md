In video challenges / questions:
2:26:55: optimized search
2:267:38: notifications, btw the notification button should also have a active state for UI, also indication of amount of notifications

My own challenges (for personalization):
At homepage: make sure there is mobile nav; make sure that pricing button redirect user to stripe checkout, make sure navbar buttons are redirectable

Automation creation: Optimistic automation UI is not "quite" working
